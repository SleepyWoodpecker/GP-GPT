Trained with (MUCH) help from [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=7">Andrej Karpathy's Youtube series</a>].

Data was obtained and cleaned from [<a href="https://grail.moe">this website</a>] <3 (thank you for helping me through my schooling days)

All rights to the data go to its respective owners.

<b>Model Details</b>
GP-GPT is a 10.8M parameter, unaligned document completer.

<b>As of now, here is what I have been able to do:</b>

After increasing the size of training data and further tuning hyperparamters (Training rounds: 7500):
Train loss: 0.98660 | Val loss: 1.27908

GP-GPT: "result or whether "is Massams staunching. Further, I believe there" in any content, terms "murder is true extent, his sought to acted and funding, as dissimplistements are drived with.

No wiser words have been said tbh.

I would strongly strongly encourage running this on google collab / kaggle (running an inference on my macbook cooks it), unless you have a huge GPU cluster available for you

<b>Notable to-dos:</b>

1. Increase the size of the dataset
2. Improve the tokenizer (perhaps the tokenizer video from the same series)
3. Alter the model to follow nanoGPT instead of miniGPT [<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT">By Karpathy too!</a>]
4. Look at the Gemma video and try to see what improvements can be made afterwards [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW7ZxaC3OtA">From this video</a>]
